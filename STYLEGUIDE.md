# Style guide

## Writing

### Spelling

- [**American English**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English) (en_US) throughout.

### Punctuation

Use the [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma):

> Pharoers are friendly, helpful, and kind.

not

> Pharoers are friendly, helpful and kind.

### Markup

Snippets of Pharo (or other) code inline should be marked up as fixed width, `==`:

> create a new instance with ==MyObject new==

References to files should also be marked up as fixed width, `==`:

> simply import your ==.image== and its associated ==.changes== files using the launcher.

References to GUI buttons inline should be marked up in bold, `""`:

> Here we clicked on the top left ""New"" icon to download a new image.

### Title

Titles written in sentence casing, without a terminating period:

> A quick tour of Pharo

not

> A Quick Tour of Pharo.
